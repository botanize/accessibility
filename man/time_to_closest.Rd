\title{Minimum travel time to closest opportunities}
\usage{
time_to_closest(data, opportunity_col, by_col, n_opportunities = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} with a travel cost matrix in long format,
containing the columns with origin ids, destination ids, the travel cost
between each origin-destination pair (this can be either in  terms of
travel time, distance or monetary costs), and number of population and
opportunities located in each origin and destination.}

\item{opportunity_col}{A \code{string} indicating the name of the column with the
number of opportunities / resources / services to be considered.}

\item{by_col}{A \code{string} with the name of the column of origin or
destination that should be considered, indicating whether accessibility
levels should by calculated by each origin (active accessibility) or
destination (passive accessibility).}

\item{n_opportunities}{A \code{numeric} value with the minimum N number of
opportunities that should be considered. Defaults to \code{1}}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} object indicating for each origin the travel time to
the closest opportunity and the id of the destination where it is
located.
}
\description{
The function calculates the minimum travel time to closest N number of
opportunities.
