\usage{
cumulative_cutoff(
  travel_matrix,
  land_use_data,
  cutoff,
  opportunity_col,
  travel_cost_col = "travel_time",
  by_col = NULL,
  active = TRUE,
  fill_missing_ids = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{travel_matrix}{A data frame. The travel matrix describing the costs
(i.e. travel time, distance, monetary cost, etc.) between the origins and
destinations in the study area. Must contain the columns \code{from_id}, \code{to_id}
and any others specified in \code{travel_cost_col}.}

\item{land_use_data}{A data frame. The distribution of opportunities within
the study area cells. Must contain the columns \code{id} and any others
specified in \code{opportunity_col}.}

\item{cutoff}{A \code{numeric}. A number indicating the travel cost cutoff.}

\item{opportunity_col}{A string. The name of the column in \code{land_use_data}
with the number of opportunities/resources/services to be considered when
calculating accessibility levels.}

\item{travel_cost_col}{A string. The name of the column in \code{travel_matrix}
with the travel cost between origins and destinations. Defaults to
\code{"travel_time"}.}

\item{by_col}{Either \code{NULL} (the default) or a \code{character} vector. When not
\code{NULL}, indicates the \code{travel_matrix} columns that should be used to group
the accessibility estimates by. For example, if \code{travel_matrix} includes a
departure time column, that specifies the departure time of each entry in
the data frame, passing \code{"departure_time"} to this argument results in
accessibility estimates grouped by origin and by departure time.}

\item{active}{A logical. Whether to calculate active accessibility (the
of opportunities that can be reached from a given origin, the default) or
passive accessibility (how many opportunities/people can reach a given
destination).}

\item{fill_missing_ids}{A \code{logical}. Calculating cumulative accessibility may
result in missing ids if the they cannot reach any of the destinations
within the specified travel cost cutoff. For example, using a travel time
cutoff of 20 minutes, when estimating the accessibility of origin \code{A} that
can only reach destinations with more than 40 minutes results in id \code{A}
not being included in the output. When \code{TRUE} (the default), the function
identifies which origins would be left out and fills their respective
accessibility values with 0, which incurs in a performance penalty.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the accessibility estimates for each origin
in the travel matrix.
}
\description{
Calculates the number of opportunities accessible under a given specified
travel cost cutoff.

This function is generic over any kind of numeric travel cost,
such as distance, time and money.
